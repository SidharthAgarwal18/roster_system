# roster_system
This exercise involves solving a rostering problem using constraint-satisfaction techniques. We consider a hospital that requires a timetable specifying the work shifts for nurses over a specified period of time. The process of generating a roster must ensure that rostering decisions comply with the requirements of the hospital as well as those of the nursing staff. We are asked to automate the roster preparation task for the hospital based on the requirements and preferences. For more details refer `Automated-Nurse-Rostering-System.pdf` and for approach used refer `writeup.txt`

## Instructions
* use `python A2.py [csv_filename]`, where csv_filename will have the input testcases as shown in `testcases/`
